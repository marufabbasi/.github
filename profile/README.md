Most of my good code is owned by the companies I have worked in. But, when I have time I work on compilers, virtual machines and robotics/machine learning.

This github account is to share someof those. Please keepin mind that I do not have alot of time to follow all the software engineering principles.

I  have built the groot interpreter in about 100minutes during a live session on youtube. The audience of my seesion was mostly non english speaking -but you should be able to  follow the code maybe. Here is the video:
