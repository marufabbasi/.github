Most of my good code is owned by the companies I have worked in. But, when I have time I work on compilers, virtual machines and robotics/machine learning.

This github account is to share some of those. Please keepin mind that I do not have a lot of time to follow all the software engineering principles.

### groot
I  have built the groot language and interpreter for it in about 100 minutes during a live session on youtube. The audience of my seesion was mostly non-english speaking -but you should be able to  follow the code maybe. Here is the video:

This is java virtual machine I have created during my undergraduate program. It can run java applications and created from scratch using C++.
